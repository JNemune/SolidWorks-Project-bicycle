## Project Overview
This repository contains a SolidWorks project focused on designing a bicycle as part of the Engineering Technical Drawing 1 unit. The project includes the creation of 9 individual parts and their assembly. The parts are designed using SolidWorks, a leading 3D CAD software, and the project serves as an excellent example of applying engineering principles to real-world design challenges.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Individual Part Files**: Each part is saved as a `.SLDPRT` file (e.g., `2.Frame.SLDPRT`) .
- **Assembly File**: The final assembly of all parts is included.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` to download the project files to your local machine.
2. **Open Files in SolidWorks**: Open the `.SLDPRT` files in SolidWorks to view or modify the parts.
3. **Assembly**: Load the assembly file to see how the parts fit together.
4. **Contribute**: Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.
